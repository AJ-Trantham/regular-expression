# regular-expression
Project 3 for cs361

Leesons Learned:

When working with recurursion problems can be solved by breaking down a problem into it's sub-problem.
Because of this when solving them, we started with the simplest problem: matching the regex a. We just worked with characters as the base subproblem and then added production rules, increasing the functionality of our regex.
